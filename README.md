# Simulation-of-magnetic-microrheology-in-FEniCS

This code is a minimum working example that simulates a magnetic microrheology experiment for use in determining local mechanical properties in hydrogel materials when modeled as a Neo-Hookean material. This implementation uses the open-source software FEniCS. Users will have to have FEniCS downloaded and installed (https://fenicsproject.org/download/). The script outputs .xdmf files which can be viewed in the open source software Paraview (https://www.paraview.org/). A .pvsm Paraview state file is provided to aid in visualization.
